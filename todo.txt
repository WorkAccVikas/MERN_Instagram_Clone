    - first sort latest post by using createdAt (already present)
    - second for each post comment need to sorted latest first

- delete comment same functionality as delete post

- on click on followers and following at /profile route UI show users in popup dialog box 

- click on own post at /profile it open full screen on modal (event delegation)

- if you don't follow any user and then you click on my following post it will display empty 
    we will add no following post image and on that image one button to redirect to Home.js
